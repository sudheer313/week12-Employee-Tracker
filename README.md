# week12-Employee-Tracker

## My Task

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. Ny assignment this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## User Story

```md
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
```

## Mock-Up

The following video shows how my application works:

### Required Dependencies

#### Install
- `npm install --save inquirer`
- `npm install --save mysql2`
- `npm install console-table`
* Intialize node terminal by installing all these dependencies and enter `mysql -u root -p` command to open MYSQL and execute  `source ./db/schema.sql` which will create the database.
* And also seed the database by execoting `source ./db/seeds.sql`


### Packages

* Satisfies all of the preceding acceptance criteria plus the following:

    * Uses the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

    * Uses the [MySQL2 package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) to connect to a MySQL database.

    * Uses the [console.table package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console.

## What I learned
This application helpmed alot to create a database and add employees and roles for employees.
I also learned to join muliple tables using joins concept and also learned to insert and update qureiries. Overall it helped to get good understanding on MYSQL and writing in-line queries. After practcing class concepts and also recalling array methods like push , I was able to understand this MYSQL concept.
 
 ## Challenges
 At start it took time to undestand rows and colums. Once I figures it out I started creating tables and primary keys and foreign keys and joining other tables . Once I figured it out how to join tables and insert and also update I managed to write some quries. I also asked BCS for assistance and reffered ashachakre0906 and kunal github repos for further understanding and I am also thankful to them.
